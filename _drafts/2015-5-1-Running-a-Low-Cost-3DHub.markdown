summary: Replicate the money you spent on your printer with 3D Hubs

After I had my Printrbot Simple Metal for about a month, I found [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) and I listed my Printerbot Simple Metal at the suggested prices.  3D Hubs suggests a $10 setup fee and $1 per cubic centemeter of filament.

After my printer had been listed about a month I received an inquiry from a college student who wanted to print an [Adafruit WiFi camera project](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-wifi-raspberry-pi-touch-cam/overview) it looked simple enough, but he wanted to do the bumper parts in a flexible material which I had not done before.  Seemed like a good excuse to try out ninjaflex so I ordered some and printed out the camera parts and learned a little bit about using ninjaflex.

I enjoyed printing the first project, and after a few weeks I received an order for a 3D printer part I printed it out and shipped it off to the customer.  I printed one more order in February and started a new job at the begining of March.

The first couple of months I had my printer I was unemployeed so I printed a ton of projects and gifts for the holidays and really got it dialed in. I had several hundred dollars of birthday and christmas amazon giftcards sitting in my amazon account so every time my daughter wanted to print with a new color I bought it and somehow I wound up with 12 different colors.

Now I was working again and I having printed most of the things I needed for my projects I decided to see if I could use 3DHubs to utilize all the filament I had bought by printing projects for people on 3D Hubs. My total 3DHubs revenue for february was only $30, so if I planned to pay for my printer and filament I needed some more orders.

3D Hubs releases a [monthly 3D printing trends report](https://www.3dhubs.com/trends) that aggrigates together data from all of their hub orders into an overview. There is a lot of interesting data in this report, including some interesting average order price data by category.

Looking over the data, all of the categories are quite a bit over $20 for the average order price, and $20 is a pretty powerful dollar amount for most products.

In march I lowered my prices to $0.20 per cubic cm and $5 setup (Lowest prices they allow) for my lowest priced medium quality option and since have done pretty well.

 and none of my projects were ready to print so I decided to see where the floor was on the 3D hubs pricing.  I found I could charge as low as $5 for setup and $0.20 per cubic centimeter of filament. I adjusted the price of my medium quality printing to the lowest prices that 3D hubs allowed and waited.



 Much of my filament is from amazon and is pretty cheap if you have prime, I print mostly in PLA http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=hatchbox+pla

 At this point 3dhubs has paid for my printer, now I am trying to see if I can pay for all my filament and the new computer I bought to handle 3d software.

 I listed my printer in february with their suggested prices of $1 per cubic cm with $10 setup and got $30 worth of orders

 I don't do any cad yet, but I know that is a service many other hubs offer, I have really enjoyed printing out people's projects, and it has actually been more fun since I lowered my prices since a lot more of my customers have been 3d designers printing out their designs for the first time.

 As a hobby it has been pretty amazing, since it sort of pays you to do it where most hobbies just empty your wallet over time.

 If you are interested I totally recommend getting a printer and listing it on 3d hubs, lots of fun.
