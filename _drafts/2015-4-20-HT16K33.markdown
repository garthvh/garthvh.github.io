When Nwazet closed down I bought a number of 8x8 Led Matrices for $1 each. I had these for a while and then bought some [Adafruit 16x8 Led Matrix Driver Backpacks - HT16K33](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1427) to power the Matrices.

This seemed like an awesome plan, but this backpack was my first lesson in making sure that the products I was using are popular and well supported.  While there are tons of examples of how to wire the adafruit backpacks with the same chip that are integrated, I could not find anything using my backpacks.

Eventually I found a [datasheet for my matrix](https://labviewhacker.com/doku.php?id=learn:hardware:components:led_matrix:nfm-12883as-11) and used a piece of paper to map out the pins from the matrix and where they needed to connect to on the backpack
