After completing a number of simple Raspberry PI tutorials, I decided I wanted to try and build a [Porta-Pi Arcade Lite](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/porta-pi-arcade-lite/) Raspberry PI retro gaming system. Since I already have a projector, several monitors and a TV the lite model without a built in screen really appealed to me.

I also liked that the Porta-Pi kits are designed and produced by one guy, Ryan Bates, that had a successful kickstarter. I really appreciated that Ryan had continued to design and provide new DIY kits after his [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2103217949/porta-pi-arcade-a-diy-mini-arcade-cabinet-for-rasp) since a lot of other projects seem to stop providing DIY kits and outsourcing everything once they become popular.

On top of the standard build I wanted to add a power button, and use a joystick with individual micro-switches so it is more obvious how everything works for my daughter.

I ordered the laser cut wood kit from [RetroBuiltGames](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/) and downloaded the PDF build manual with a bill of materials and set about ordering parts. Being a software engineer every project needs to have some feature creep so some of the parts I got are not necessary to build a working arcade.

I also wound up buying two extra buttons and two ball tops after my daughter Elsie decided that we each needed a button that was our favorite color (hers pink, mine purple) and that we should have a pink ball top. It turns out that a pink arcade button is a a real hard to find item, I finally managed to find one in Hawaii at [Paradise Arcade Shop](http://www.paradisearcadeshop.com/il-psl-l/720-il-psl-l-paradise-arcade-pink.html#/microswitch_force-50_gram_microswitch). They also had a purple button and a Zippyy joystick with 4 micro-switches and changeable ball tops.

I already had a rocker switch to use with the shutdown circuit and a raspberry pi and power supply. I also used rubber feet, stain, wood glue and clamps I already had.

All of the parts started shipping quickly after I ordered them and I received the wood kit and buttons in the mail in a few days.

    <p>I followed the instructions in the manual and fitted the pieces together a couple of times before staining and gluing. I have found my iPad to be really useful for viewing PDF’s, videos and tutorials while working on projects with the Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p>After fitting things together I laid out the pieces on some newspaper and stained the wood.</p>
