After I had my Printrbot Simple Metal for about a month, I found [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) and I listed my Printerbot Simple Metal at the suggested prices.  3D Hubs suggests a $10 setup fee and $1 per cubic centemeter of filament.

After my printer had been listed about a month I received an inquiry from a college student who wanted to print an [Adafruit WiFi camera project](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-wifi-raspberry-pi-touch-cam/overview) it looked simple enough, but he wanted to do the bumper parts in a flexible material which I had not done before.  Seemed like a good excuse to try out ninjaflex so I ordered some and printed out the camera parts and learned a little bit about using ninjaflex. 

I enjoyed printing the first project, and after a few weeks I received an order for a 3D printer part I printed it out and shipped it off to the customer.  I printed one more order in February and started a new job at the begining of March. 

The first couple of months I had my printer I was unemployeed so I printed a ton of projects and gifts for the holidays and really got it dialed in. I had several hundred dollars of birthday and christmas amazon giftcards sitting in my amazon account so every time my daughter wanted to print with a new color I bought it and somehow I wound up with 12 different colors.

Now I was working again and I having printed most of the things I needed for my projects I decided to see if I could use 3DHubs to utilize all the filament I had bought by printing projects for people on 3D Hubs. My total 3DHubs revenue for february was only $30, so if I planned to pay for my printer and filament I needed some more orders.

3D Hubs releases a [monthly 3D printing trends report](https://www.3dhubs.com/trends) that aggrigates together some of their  



 and none of my projects were ready to print so I decided to see where the floor was on the 3D hubs pricing.  I found I could charge as low as $5 for setup and $0.20 per cubic centimeter of filament. I adjusted the price of my medium quality printing to the lowest prices that 3D hubs allowed and waited.
