## Styles

For the site styles for my site I am trying to use as little custom css as possible, almost everything is standard Bootstrap 3 markup.

* Using CDN Hosted [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) styles and javascript.
* Flatly Theme by [Bootswatch](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#bootswatch_tab)
* Font Awesome Icons

## Content Management

After years of developing my own content management systems I have completely switched to markdown for security and ease of use.  Using the github Atom editor primarily. The content of this static site is built out using Jekyll for Github Pages.

I also stole some of the site structure and github connected features from @haacked after reading about them on his blog.

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Content built with markdown
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Custom domain registered with GoDaddy
