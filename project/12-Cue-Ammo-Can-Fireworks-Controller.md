              I decided it might be fun to try and build an electronic fireworks controller for the 4th this year.  It seems as though there are a ton of various options out there both DIY and commercial.  I think I am going to try and model a .50 Cal ammo can insert for the wire connections, battery and buttons, and hopefully storage for the wires and ignitors.
              </p>
              <p>
              12 Cues should be more than enough for my purposes and I found some inexpensive 12 wire speaker terminals that should look cool. I also to found some square red buttons and a key switch I like.</p>

              I have ordered up a bunch of parts and have started to map out my design. I think the whole project will cost about $100. The first thing I did was a quick scale sketch on a piece of paper, and then I started to work on my design using tinkercad and my digital caliper.
              </p>
              <p> I think I want to design an insert for a .50 Cal ammo box that will cover the lead acid battery and allow for storage of the wiring on the side of the can.  I will also need a box to hold the battery in the ammo box.  I decided to use an ammo box because of the weight of the sealed lead acid battery and the easy availability and nice waterproof seal available on ammo cans.
              </p>
              <p>After some quick measurements it seems that everything I want to use should fit nicely.  </p>
              <p>
              I want to have a key switch to activate the whole unit, and a rocker switch and LED's for Test and Armed modes once the key switch is activated.

              I have been playing around with the TinkerCad drawings as the parts come in.  I have some left over pink and magenta filament so I printed the face of the controller so I could test fit some of the parts.

              <p>
              I think I can fit everything I need for 12 ques and still have quite a bit of room left for storing the ignition wires and ignitors as well.

                With two days before the 4th it is mad scramble time. All the parts arrived and every thing fits.  The first button and associated lights work correctly with the key and toggle switch, now I just need to solder the resistors and leds for each of the 12 buttons.
