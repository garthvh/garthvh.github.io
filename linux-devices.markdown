    <h3>Toshiba Chromebook 2 - 4GB RAM</h3>
      <p>Great Chromebook running Ubuntu via Crouton. A chromebook with crouton is a great way to learn linux and play with different distros without having to fight with network hardware.</p>

    <p>MSI Nightblade gaming PC with a quad core I5, 16GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GTX960 Video Card.  With room for a full size video card, WIFI built in, a somewhat small case and an optical drive slot this has been a great PC.</p>
