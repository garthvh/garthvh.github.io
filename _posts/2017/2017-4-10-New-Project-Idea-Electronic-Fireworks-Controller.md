I decided it might be fun to try and build an electronic fireworks controller for the 4th this year.  It seems as though there are a ton of various options out there both DIY and commercial.  I think I am going to try and model a .50 Cal ammo can insert for the wire connections, battery and buttons, and hopefully storage for the wires and ignitors.

12 Cues should be more than enough for my purposes and I found some inexpensive 12 wire speaker terminals that should look cool. I also to found some square red buttons and a key switch I like.
