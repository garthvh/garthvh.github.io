After I had my Printrbot Simple Metal for about a month, I found [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) and I listed my printer at the suggested prices.  3D Hubs suggests a $10 setup fee and $1 per cubic centimeter of filament.

After my printer had been listed about a month I received an inquiry from a college student who wanted to print an [Adafruit WiFi camera project](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-wifi-raspberry-pi-touch-cam/overview) it looked simple enough, but he wanted to do the bumper parts in a flexible material which I had not done before.  Seemed like a good excuse to try out ninjaflex so I ordered some and printed out the camera parts and learned a little bit about using ninjaflex.

I enjoyed printing the first project, and after a few weeks I received an order for a 3D printer part I printed it out and shipped it off to the customer.  I printed one more order in February and started a new job at the beginning of March.

The first couple of months I had my printer I was unemployed so I printed a ton of projects and gifts for the holidays and really got it dialed in. I had several hundred dollars of birthday and Christmas amazon giftcards sitting in my amazon account so every time my daughter wanted to print with a new color I bought it and somehow I wound up with 12 different colors.

Now I was working again and I having printed most of the things I needed for my projects I decided to see if I could use 3DHubs to utilize all the filament I had bought by printing projects for people on 3D Hubs. My total 3D Hubs revenue for February was only $30, so if I planned to pay for my printer and filament I needed some more orders.

3D Hubs releases a [monthly 3D printing trends report](https://www.3dhubs.com/trends) that aggregates together data from all of their hub orders into an overview. There is a lot of interesting data in this report, including some interesting average order price data by category.

Looking over the data, all of the categories are quite a bit over $20 for the average order price, and $20 is a pretty powerful dollar amount for most products.

In March I lowered my prices to $0.20 per cubic cm and $5 setup (Lowest prices they allow) for my lowest priced medium quality option and since have done pretty well.

At this point 3dhubs has paid for my printer, now I am trying to see if I can pay for all my filament and the new computer I bought to handle 3d software. While I could probably make more money doing software development in my spare time, I have had a lot of fun printing people's projects and it has not occupied a ton of my time. As a hobby it has been pretty amazing, since it deposits money in my paypal account that I can use to buy more stuff from adafruit.

I have now completed more than 25 orders and am the [second highest rated Printrbot Simple Metal on 3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/3dprint/printer/Printrbot_Simple_Metal) in the world, and based on the total of 161 reviews for hubs in Seattle it appears that I have accounted for 15-20% of the total order volume on [3D Hubs for Seattle](https://www.3dhubs.com/seattle).

Printing people's projects has really been a great experience and I highly recommend it to people who have their printer dialed in and are trying to figure out what to do with their filament.
