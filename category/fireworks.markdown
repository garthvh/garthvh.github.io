                    I decided it might be fun to try and build an electronic fireworks controller for the 4th this year.  It seems as though there are a ton of various options out there both DIY and commercial.  I think I am going to try and model a .50 Cal ammo can insert for the wire connections, battery and buttons, and hopefully storage for the wires and ignitors.

                    12 Cues should be more than enough for my purposes and I found some inexpensive 12 wire speaker terminals that should look cool. I also to found some square red buttons and a key switch I like.</p>

                    I have ordered up a bunch of parts and have started to map out my design. I think the whole project will cost about $100. The first thing I did was a quick scale sketch on a piece of paper, and then I started to work on my design using tinkercad and my digital caliper.
                    </p>
                    <p> I think I want to design an insert for a .50 Cal ammo box that will cover the lead acid battery and allow for storage of the wiring on the side of the can.  I will also need a box to hold the battery in the ammo box.  I decided to use an ammo box because of the weight of the sealed lead acid battery and the easy availability and nice waterproof seal available on ammo cans.
                    </p>
                    <p>After some quick measurements it seems that everything I want to use should fit nicely.  </p>
                    <p>
                    I want to have a key switch to activate the whole unit, and a rocker switch and LED's for Test and Armed modes once the key switch is activated.

                    I have been playing around with the TinkerCad drawings as the parts come in.  I have some left over pink and magenta filament so I printed the face of the controller so I could test fit some of the parts.

                    <p>
                    I think I can fit everything I need for 12 ques and still have quite a bit of room left for storing the ignition wires and ignitors as well.
