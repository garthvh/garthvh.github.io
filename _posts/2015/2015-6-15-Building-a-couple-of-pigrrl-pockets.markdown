summary: Building a couple Pocket Pigrrl RetroPi 3D Printed Gaming Handhelds

I am building two customized Pocket Pigrrl's for my daughter and niece.  As a kid the NES system was mine, but my younger sister owned the original gameboy which I constantly stole from her on car trips so it seemed right that both our kids have little portable gameboy like devices. I am also hoping that this device will help keep mommy's phone away from the children.

I started out by cutting down the half sized perma proto board and laying out the buttons for a 4 button pigrrl.  I used my dremel to cut down the perma proto boards and then attached the 6mm tactile buttons onto the cut down proto board. Then I layed out the Raspberry Pi A+, PowerBoost 1000C and Audio Amp boards inside the case and started cutting some wire.

Next I wired up the switch and applied the heatshrink tubing, then I attached the wires to the audio jack of the raspberry pi and connected them to the PowerBoost.
