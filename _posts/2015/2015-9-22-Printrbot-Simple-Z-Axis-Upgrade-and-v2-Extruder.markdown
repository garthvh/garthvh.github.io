summary: Installing the Printrbot Simple Z Axis Upgrade and v2 Extruder

After almost a year with my Printrbot I was excited to see the new Printrbot Simple Z and X axis upgrades they recently made available. There have been a couple of parts that I have had to print in multiple pieces because my printer was too small. I got my new heated bed recently, and I don't have a very large space for my printer so I decided to get the Z axis upgrade since it would not increase the footprint of my printer at all.

I have also been waiting to try out the new v2 extruder, the v1 extruder has worked great for me and has been acceptable with flexible filaments with some extra printed parts, but I have to watch the printer too closely when using Ninjaflex
