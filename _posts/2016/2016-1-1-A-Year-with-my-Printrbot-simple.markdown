summary: A Year with my Printrbot Simple
---

I purchased my Printrbot Simple kit last year on black friday and have been printing with it for a little over a year now.  I originally bought it in order to print out some Raspberry Pi and Arduino cases to add some polish to those projects, and because I thought it would be fun for my daughter.

I bought the Printrbot Simple partly because it is not a big box like many 3D printers, all of the axis of the printer are visible and it has a pretty small footprint and I don't have a lot of space.

I did not start out with much knowledge of 3D model software, and I still can't do much more than slightly adjust model files. I have printed a lot of things from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/garthvh/about) and  tried to document most of the things I have made using public models.

I initially connected my printer directly to my computer using both Ubuntu and Windows 8.  I found that linux was a bit more reliable, but still having to be tethered to my PC was annoying.  I found [OctoPrint]() and used one of my Raspberry PI boards to connect to my printer wirelessly

I have completed a couple of pretty big projects, I built a [Ciclop 3D Scannner]()

And I built a small version of the MakerBot Fairytale Castle
