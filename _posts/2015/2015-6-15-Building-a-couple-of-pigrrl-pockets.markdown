summary: Building a couple Pocket Pigrrl RetroPi 3D Printed Gaming Handhelds

I am building two customized Pocket Pigrrl's for my daughter and niece.  As a kid the NES system was mine, but my younger sister owned the original gameboy which I constantly stole from her on car trips so it seemed right that both our kids have little portable gameboy like devices. I am also hoping that this device will help keep mommy's phone away from the children.
