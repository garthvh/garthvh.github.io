I have been playing around with the TinkerCad drawings as the parts come in.  I have some left over pink and magenta filament so I printed the face of the controller so I could test fit some of the parts.

<div class="col-6">
    <img alt="Prototype 1" src="{{ "/assets/img/fireworks/03_prototype_pink.jpg" | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" />
</div>

I think I can fit everything I need for 12 ques and still have quite a bit of room left for storing the ignition wires and ignitors as well.
