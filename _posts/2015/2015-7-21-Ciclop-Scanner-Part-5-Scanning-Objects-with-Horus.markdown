After getting my Ciclop Scanner assembled I installed horus on the Ubuntu Trusty chroot on my Toshiba Chromebook 2 and Horus runs great.

I had to run through the configuration a couple of times, and it took a little fiddling to get the laser lines nice and narrow.  The scan results seemed best when there was bright ambient light but not direct sunlight or lamp light.

I used a plastic corn toy for my first scan and am very pleased with the results.
