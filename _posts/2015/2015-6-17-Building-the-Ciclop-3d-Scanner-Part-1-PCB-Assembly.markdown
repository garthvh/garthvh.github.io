Printing out all of the parts, using alloy 910 for the shaft coupler.

I used a hacksaw to cut all the threaded rod pieces and have started to print the necessary parts in hatchbox orange PLA.  Some of the parts are bigger than I am able to print with my simple metal, but others have had these issues as well.
